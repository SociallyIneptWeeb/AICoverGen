# TODO

* need to make project version (in `pyproject.toml`) dynamic so that it is updated automatically when a new release is made
* should specify in colab notebook which link in output of last cell should be clicked
* start logging in modules from the ultimate_rvc project
  * might not need to log in every module but start doing it for relevant operations such as
    * when catching errors
    * when significant events happen

* should rename instances of "models" to "voice models"

* set `format= .wav` potentially for all audio components

* enable server side rendering (requires installing node and setting ssr_mode = true in .launch) (DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT)
  * Also needs to set GRADIO_NODE_PATH to point to the node executable
  * and set node_port to a port that is not already in use
  * problem is that on windows there is a ERR_UNSUPPORTED_ESM_URL_SCHEME which needs to be fixed by gradio
    * see here https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/31710
    * Might still work on linux though

* fix problem with typing of block.launch()
  * problem stems from doing from gradio import routes
  * so instead should import from gradio.routes directly
  * open a pr with changes

* need to fix the `INFO: Could not find files for the given pattern(s)` on startup of web application (DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT)
  * this is an error that gradio needs to fix

* Remove reset button on slider components (DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT)
  * this is a gradio feature that needs to be removed.

* should use .expand() and .collapse() event listeners on accordions to programmatically reset the state of accordions to what they were before after user has refreshed the page
* use gr.browserstate to allow state to be preserved acrross page loads.

* rework other settings tab
  * this should also contain other settings such as the ability to change the theme of the app
  * there should be a button to apply settings which will reload the app with the new settings

* fix module initialization so that sample models are not downloaded every time the app is started
  * only way to do this is to force the users themselves to manually download sample models
  * by calling the initialize function (which in that case should be exposed via the cli)

* use pyinstaller to install app into executable that also includes sox and ffmpeg as dependencies (DLLs)

* make note about having to possibly do refresh (f5) when using colab to make default models appear
  * should also try to fix this
* make note about audio component resetting sometimes when hitting press play
  * should also try to fix this
  * might be related some error messages on the terminal with broken communication:
  
    ``` console

    ```

* update stubs

* figure out way of making ./urvc commands execute faster
  * when ultimate rvc is downloaded as a pypi package the exposed commands are much faster so investigate this

## optimization of package installation

* once diffq-fixed is used by audio-separator we can remove the url dependency on windows
* we will still need to wait for uv to make it easy to install package with torch dependency
  * it is still necessary to install pytorch first as it is not on pypi index

## Project/task management

* Should find tool for project/task management
* Tool should support:
  * hierarchical tasks
  * custom labels and or priorities on tasks
  * being able to filter tasks based on those labels
  * being able to close and resolve tasks
  * Being able to integrate with vscode
  * Access for multiple people (in a team)
* Should migrate the content of this file into tool
* Potential candidates
  * GitHub projects
    * Does not yet support hierarchical tasks so no
  * Trello
    * Does not seem to support hierarchical tasks either
  * Notion
    * Seems to support hierarchical tasks, but is complicated
  * Todoist
    * seems to support both hierarchical tasks, custom labels, filtering on those labels, multiple users and there are unofficial plugins for vscode.

## Front end

### Modularization

* Improve modularization of web code using helper functions defined [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/WoWoWoWololo/wrapping-layouts/blob/main/app.py)
* Split front-end modules into further sub-modules.
  * Structure of web folder should be:
    * `web`
      * `manage_models`
        * `__init__.py`
        * `main.py`
      * `manage_audio`
        * `__init__.py`
        * `main.py`
      * `generate_song_covers`
        * `__init__.py`
        * `main.py`
        * `one_click_generation`
          * `__init__.py`
          * `main.py`
          * `accordions`
            * `__init__.py`
            * `options_x.py` ... ?
        * `multi_step_generation`
          * `__init__.py`
          * `main.py`
          * `accordions`
            * `__init__.py`
            * `step_X.py` ...
      * `common.py`
    * For `multi_step_generation/step_X.py`, its potential render function might have to take the set of all "input tracks" in the multi-step generation tab, so these will then have to be defined in `multi_step_generation/main.py`. Other components passed to `multi_step_generation/main.py` might also need to be passed further down to `multi_step_generation/step_X.py`
    * For `one_click_generation/option_X.py`, its potential render function should
        render the accordion for the given options and return the components defined in the accordion? Other components passed to `one_click_generation/main.py` might also need to be passed further down to `one_click_generation/option_X.py`
  * Import components instead of passing them as inputs to render functions (DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT)
    * We have had problems before with component ids when components are instantiated outside a Blocks context in a separate module and then import into other modules and rendered in their blocks contexts.

### Multi-step generation

* add description describing how to use each accordion and and suggestions for workflows
* If possible merge two consecutive event listeners using `update_cached_songs` in the song retrieval accordion.
* add option for adding more input tracks to the mix song step
  * new components should be created dynamically based on a textfield with names and a button for creating new component
  * when creating a new component a new transfer button and dropdown should also be created
  * and the transfer choices for all dropdowns should be updated to also include the new input track
  * we need to consider how to want to handle vertical space
    * should be we make a new row once more than 3 tracks are on one row?
      * yes and there should be also created the new slider on a new row
      * right under the first row (which itself is under the row with song dir dropdown)

* should also have the possiblity to add more tracks to the pitch shift accordion.

* add a confirmation box with warning if trying to transfer output track to input track that is not empty.
  * could also have the possibility to ask the user to transfer to create a new input track and transfer the output track to it.
  * this would just be the same pop up confirmation box as before but in addition to yes and cancel options it will also have a "transfer to new input track" option.
  * we need custom javasctip for this.

* Fix hashes of identical files being different for one-click and multi-step generation (DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT)
  * Seems to work except for when first running one click generation and then multi-step generation
    * What happens is that when transferring an output track in multi-step generation the transferred output track is re-encoded (or possibly just re-saved) on disk which causes the hash to be different after transfering
    * This happens only when transfering from the output of step 0 (song retrieval) and step 4 (vocal postprocessing)
    * curiously, these steps were also the ones causing problems with loading output tracks before when we were auto transfering output tracks.
      * Hence the problem with hashing seems to be related to the gradio bug where loading into audio components does not work after a while when using too many consecutive event listeners.
    * Also, it should be noted that transfering a manually uploaded file from step 0 does not result in reencoding (and hence a new hash)
      * perhaps this is because a manually uplaoded audio file is already in the correct wav format while a downloaded song might be in a wrong wav format?

### Common

* save default values for options for song generation in an `SongCoverOptionDefault` enum.
  * then reference this enum across the two tabs
  * and also use `list[SongCoverOptionDefault]` as input to reset settings click event listener in single click generation tab.
* use `Block.queue` with parameter `max_size` set to a non-null value and `default_concurrency_limit` increased in order to improve user responsiveness
* use `Block.launch()` with `max_file_size` to prevent too large uploads
* experiment with `show_error` parameters on `Block.launch()`
* Persist state of app (currently selected settings etc.) across re-renders
  * This includes:
    * refreshing a browser windows
    * Opening app in new browser window
    * Maybe it should also include when app is started anew?
  * Possible solutions
    * Save any changes to components to a session dictionary and load from it upon refresh
      * See [here](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/issues/3106#issuecomment-1694704623)
      * Problem is that this solution might not work with accordions or other types of blocks
    * Use localstorage
      * see [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/YiXinCoding/gradio-chat-history/blob/main/app.py) and [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/radames/gradio_window_localStorage/blob/main/app.py)

    * Whenever the state of a component is changed save the new state to a custom JSON file.
      * Then whenever the app is refreshed load the current state of components from the JSON file
      * This solution should probably work for Block types that are not components
* Fix that gradio removes special symbols from audio paths when loaded into audio components (DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT)
  * includes parenthesis, question marks, etc.
  * its a gradio bug so report?
* Fix Problem with gradio reload mode not working (DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT)
  * Has been reported to gradio here [here](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/issues/8917)
* Add button for cancelling any currently running jobs (DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT)
  * Not supported by Gradio natively
  * Also difficult to implement manually as Gradio seems to be running called backend functions in thread environments
* dont show error upon missing confirmation (DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT)
  * can return `gr.update()`instead of raising an error in relevant event listener function
  * but problem is that subsequent steps will still be executed in this case

### temporary gradio files

* clearing temporary files can be candled with the `delete_cache` parameter
  * Only seems to work if all windows are closed before closing the app process
* When hosting online:
  * clearing of temporary files should happen after a user logs in and out
  * and in this case it should only be temporary files for the active user that are cleared
    * Is that even possible to control?

## Back end

### `generate_song_cover.py`

* find framework for caching intermediate results rather than relying on your homemade system

  * Joblib: <https://medium.com/@yuxuzi/unlocking-efficiency-in-machine-learning-projects-with-joblib-a-python-pipeline-powerhouse-feb0ebfdf4df>
  * scikit learn: <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/compose.html#pipeline>

  * <https://softwarepatternslexicon.com/machine-learning/infrastructure-and-scalability/workflow-management/pipeline-caching/>
  * <https://github.com/bmabey/provenance>
  * <https://docs.sweep.dev/blogs/file-cache>

* Support specific audio formats for intermediate audio file?
  * it might require some more code to support custom output format for all pipeline functions.

* expand `_get_model_name` so that it can take any audio file in an intermediate audio folder as input (DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT)
  * Function should then try to recursively
    * look for a corresponding json metadata file
    * find the model name in that file if it exists
    * otherwise find the path in the input field in the metadata file
    * repeat
  * should also consider whether input audio file belongs to step before audio conversion step
* use pydantic models to constrain numeric inputs (DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT)
  * for inputs to `convert` function for example
  * Use `Annotated[basic type, Field[constraint]]` syntax along with a @validate_call decorator on functions
  * Problem is that pyright does not support `Annotated` so we would have to switch to mypy
  
### `manage_models.py`

* use pandas.read_json to load public models table (DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT)

## CLI

### Potentially implement audio conversion

* When using CLI input files might not be .wave format. This is a problem because
  * `pedalboard.io` does not support `aac` and `adts` (`m4a`)
    * workaround: accept that these two formats are not supported?
  * `pydub.AudioSegment.from_wav` will not work
    * workaround: use `pydub.AudioSegment.from_file()`?
  * `soundfile` does not support `mp3`,`aac` or `adts`
    * workaround: use `librosa` instead?
* Global solution
  * Implement pre-processing step that saves input file in `.wav` format if necessary before doing anything else and then using that saved audio file for further professing
  * Simpler solution: Always do pre-processing and do not save to file but instead save to a stream that can be used for later processing

### Add remaining CLI interfaces

* Interface for `core.manage_models`
* Interface for `core.manage_audio`
* Interfaces for individual pipeline functions defined in `core.generate_song_covers`

## python package management

* update dependencies in pyproject.toml
  * use latest compatible version of all packages
  * remove commented out code, unless strictly necessary

## Audio separation

* expand back-end function(s) so that they are parametrized by both model type as well as model settings
  * Need to decide whether we only want to support common model settings or also settings that are unique to each model
    * It will probably be the latter, which will then require some extra checks.
  * Need to decide which models supported by `audio_separator` that we want to support
    * Not all of them seem to work
    * Probably MDX models and MDXC models
    * Maybe also VR and demucs?
  * Revisit online guide for optimal models and settings
* In multi-step generation tab
  * Expand audio-separation accordion so that model can be selected and appropriate settings for that model can then be selected.
    * Model specific settings should expand based on selected model
* In one-click generation
  * Should have an "vocal extration" option accordion
    * Should be able to choose which audio separation steps to include in pipeline
      * possible steps
        * step 1: separating audio form instrumentals
        * step 2: separating main vocals from background vocals:
        * step 3: de-reverbing vocals
      * Should pick steps from dropdown?
      * For each selected step a new sub-accordion with options for that step will then appear
        * Each accordion should include general settings
        * We should decide whether model specific settings should also be supported
        * We Should also decide whether sub-accordion should setting for choosing a model and if so render specific settings based the chosen model
    * Alternative layout:
      * have option to choose number of separation steps
      * then dynamically render sub accordions for each of the selected number of steps
        * In this case it should be possible to choose models for each accordion
          * this field should be iniitally empty
        * Other setttings should probably have sensible defaults that are the same
      * It might also be a good idea to then have an "examples" pane with recommended combinations of extractions steps
      * When one of these is selected, then the selected number of accordions with the preset settings should be filled out
  * optimize pre-processing
    * check <https://github.com/ArkanDash/Multi-Model-RVC-Inference>
  * Alternatives to `audio-separator` package:
    * [Deezer Spleeter](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter)
      * supports both CLI and python package
    * [Asteroid](https://github.com/asteroid-team/asteroid)
    * [Nuzzle](https://github.com/nussl/nussl)

## GitHub

### Actions

* linting with Ruff
* typechecking with Pyright
*or use pre-commit?

### README

* Fill out TBA sections in README
* Add note about not using with VPN?

### Releases

* Make regular releases like done for Applio
  * Will be an `.exe` file that when run unzips contents into application folder, where `./urvc run` can then be executed.
  * Could it be possible to have `.exe` file just start webapp when clicked?

### Other

* In the future consider detaching repo from where it is forked from:
  * because it is not possible to make the repo private otherwise
  * see: <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/detaching-a-fork>

## Incorporate upstream changes

* Incorporate RVC code from [rvc-cli](https://github.com/blaisewf/rvc-cli) (i.e. changes from Applio)
  * more options for voice conversion and more efficient voice conversion
  * batch conversion sub-tab
  * TTS tab
  * Model training tab
  * support more pre-trained models
    * sub-tab under "manage models" tab
  * support for querying online database with many models that can be downloaded
  * support for audio and model analysis.
  * Voice blending tab
* Incorporate latest changes from [RVC-WebUI](https://github.com/RVC-Project/Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI)

## Vocal Conversion

* support arbitrary combination of pitch detection algorithms
  * source: <https://github.com/gitmylo/audio-webui>
* Investigate using onnx models for inference speedup on cpu
* Add more pitch detection methods
  * pm
  * harvest
  * dio
  * rvmpe+
* Implement multi-gpu Inference

## TTS conversion

* also include original edge voice as output
  * source: <https://github.com/litagin02/rvc-tts-webui>

## Model management

### Training models

* have learning rate for training
  * source: <https://github.com/gitmylo/audio-webui>
* have a quick training button
  * or have preprocess dataset, extract features and generate index happen by default
* Support a loss/training graph
  * source: <https://github.com/gitmylo/audio-webui>

### Download models

* Support batch downloading multiple models
  * requires a tabular request form where both a link column and a name column has to be filled out
  * we can allow selecting multiple items from public models table and then copying them over
* support quering online database for models matching a given search string like what is done in applio app
  * first n rows of online database should be shown by default in public models table
    * more rows should be retrieved by scrolling down or clicking a button
  * user search string should filter/narrow returned number of rows in public models table
  * When clicking a set of rows they should then be copied over for downloading in the "download" table
* support a column with preview sample in public models table
  * Only possible if voice snippets are also returned when querying the online database
* Otherwise we can always support voice snippets for voice models that have already been downloaded
  * run model on sample text ("quick brown fox runs over the lazy") after it is downloaded
  * save the results in a `audio/model_preview` folder
  * Preview can then be loaded into a preview audio component when selecting a model from a dropdown
  * or if we replace the dropdown with a table with two columns we can have the audio track displayed in the second column

### Model analysis

* we could provide a new tab to analyze an existing model like what is done in applio
  * or this tab could be consolidated with the delete model tab?

* we could also provide extra model information after model is downloaded
  * potentialy in dropdown to expand?

## Audio management

### General

* Support audio information tool like in applio?
  * A new tab where you can upload a song to analyze?
* more elaborate solution:
  * tab where where you
    * can select any song directory
    * select any step in the audio generation pipeline
    * then select any intermediate audio file generated in that step
    * Then have the possibility to
      * Listen to the song
      * see a table with its metadata (based on its associated `.json` file)
        * add timestamp to json files so they can be sorted in table according to creation date
      * And other statistics in a separate component (graph etc.)
  * Could have delete buttons both at the level of song_directory, step, and for each song?
  * Also consider splitting intermediate audio tracks for each step in to subfolder (0,1,2,3...)

## Audio post-processing

* Support more effects from the `pedalboard` pakcage.
  * Guitar-style effects: Chorus, Distortion, Phaser, Clipping
  * Loudness and dynamic range effects: Compressor, Gain, Limiter
  * Equalizers and filters: HighpassFilter, LadderFilter, LowpassFilter
  * Spatial effects: Convolution, Delay, Reverb
  * Pitch effects: PitchShift
  * Lossy compression: GSMFullRateCompressor, MP3Compressor
  * Quality reduction: Resample, Bitcrush
  * NoiseGate
  * PeakFilter

## Audio Mixing

* Add main gain loudness slider?
* Add option to equalize output audio with respect to input audio
  * i.e. song cover gain (and possibly also more general dynamics) should be the same as those for source song.
  * check to see if pydub has functionality for this
  * otherwise a simple solution would be computing the RMS of the difference between the loudness of the input and output track

  ```python
    rms = np.sqrt(np.mean(np.square(signal)))
    dB  = 20*np.log10(rms)
    #add db to output file in mixing function (using pydub)
  ```

  * When this option is selected the option to set main gain of ouput should be disabled?

* add more equalization options
  * using `pydub.effects` and `pydub.scipy_effects`?

## Custom UI

* Experiment with new themes including [Building new ones](https://www.gradio.app/guides/theming-guid)
  * first of all make new theme that is like the default gradio 4 theme in terms of using semi transparent orange as the main color and semi-transparent grey for secondary color. The new gradio 5 theme is good apart from using solid colors so maybe use that as base theme.
  * Support both dark and light theme in app?
  * Add Support for changing theme in app?
  * Use Applio theme as inspiration for default theme?
* Experiment with using custom CSS
  * Pass `css = {css_string}` to `gr.Blocks` and use `elem_classes` and `elem_id` to have components target the styles define in the CSS string.
* Experiment with [custom DataFrame styling](https://www.gradio.app/guides/styling-the-gradio-dataframe)
* Experiment with custom Javascript
* Look for opportunities for defining new useful custom components

## Real-time vocal conversion

* Should support being used as OBS plugin
* Latency is real issue
* Implementations details:
  * implement back-end in Rust?
  * implement front-end using svelte?
  * implement desktop application using C++ or C#?
* see <https://github.com/w-okada/voice-changer> and <https://github.com/RVC-Project/obs-rvc> for inspiration

## AI assistant mode

* similar to vocal conversion streaming but instead of converting your voice on the fly, it should:
  * take your voice,
  * do some language modelling (with an LLM or something)
  * then produce an appropriate verbal response
* We already have Kyutais [moshi](https://moshi.chat/?queue_id=talktomoshi)
  * Maybe that model can be finetuned to reply with a voice
  * i.e. your favorite singer, actor, best friend, family member.

## Ultimate RVC bot for discord

* maybe also make a forum on  discord?

## Make app production ready

* have a "report a bug" tab like in applio?
* should have separate accounts for users when hosting online
  * use `gr.LoginButton` and `gr.LogoutButton`?

* deploy using docker
  * See <https://www.gradio.app/guides/deploying-gradio-with-docker>
* Host on own web-server with Nginx
  * see <https://www.gradio.app/guides/running-gradio-on-your-web-server-with-nginx>

* Consider having concurrency limit be dynamic, i.e. instead of always being 1 for jobs using gpu consider having it depend upon what resources are available.
  * We can app set the GPU_CONCURRENCY limit to be os.envrion["GPU_CONCURRENCY_LIMIT] or 1 and then pass GPU_CONCURRENCY as input to places where event listeners are defined

## Colab notebook

* find way of saving virtual environment with python 3.11 in colab notebook (DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT)
  * so that this environment can be loaded directly rather than downloading all dependencies every time app is opened

## Testing

* Add example audio files to use for testing
  * Should be located in `audio/examples`
  * could have sub-folders `input` and `output`
    * in `output` folder we have `output_audio.ext` files each with a corresponding `input_audio.json` file containing metadata explaining arguments used to generate output
    * We can then test that actual output is close enough to expected output using audio similarity metric.
* Setup unit testing framework using pytest
